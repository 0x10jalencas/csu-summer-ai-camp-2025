**Project Overview:** This project challenges participants to design an AI-powered predictive system that identifies students at risk of attrition based on housing-related factors. Using comprehensive housing data from the StarRez system, participants will develop models to predict which students are more likely to continue their education and graduate successfully. The system aims to identify patterns and correlations that can inform interventions and support programs to improve student retention rates across the CSU system.  

**Team Project Objectives:**  
- Develop predictive models using housing data to identify students at risk of attrition  
- Identify key factors that correlate with successful student outcomes
- Create actionable insights for housing staff and student success teams
- Support early intervention strategies to improve retention rates
- Scale solutions across multiple CSU campuses using StarRez

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
